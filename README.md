# End-to-End Chatbot Using Python

This repository contains a project to build an **End-to-End Chatbot** using Python. The chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning to provide interactive and intelligent conversations. It includes components for text preprocessing, intent recognition, response generation, and deployment.
## 📌 Overview

Document analysis is essential for tasks like text extraction, sentiment analysis, keyword generation, and summarization. By leveraging the capabilities of **LLMs**, this project offers an efficient way to process and derive meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Text Extraction**:
  - Automatic extraction of key paragraphs, sentences, and phrases.
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Determine the sentiment of the document or its sections.
- **Keyword Generation**:
  - Extract key terms and phrases from text for indexing or search.
- **Summarization**:
  - Generate concise summaries of lengthy documents.
- **Custom Models**:
  - Fine-tune pretrained models for domain-specific document analysis.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.	Clone the repository:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaserselvam/Document-Analysis.git
cd Document-Analysis
```

2.	Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📚 Usage

1.	Place your document (e.g., .pdf, .docx, or .txt) in the content/ directory.
2.	Use the **EDA and Text Extraction notebook** to extract text and preprocess it.
3.	Run the **Document Analysis notebook** to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and summarization.
4.	Evaluate the results and visualize insights.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for image-based documents.
- Enable real-time document analysis via a web interface using Streamlit.
- Expand language support for multilingual document analysis.
- Fine-tune LLMs for domain-specific tasks.
